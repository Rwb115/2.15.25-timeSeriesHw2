3. Data Collection Methodology (2 points). State how the data is collected, by whom, how often, etc. 

- Although FRED distributes the data, the information was collected by the United States Census Bureau with the Monthly Retail Trade Survey. The purpose of the survey is to collect monthly data on retail and food service stores to provide current and past estimates of sales.
- The method involves a mail out and in survey, which involves around 13,000 retail establishments. It is all collected on one survey form. The survey itself has been monthly since 1951, with a new sample chosen every 5 years.

4. Why does this data set intrigue you? (2 points).

- Retail operations are a part of daily life, and I have always been particularly fascinated with fashion and anything that accompanies it. With this dataset examining family clothing retail operations, especially with the increasing trend of shopping for clothing online with the rise of Shein and other e-commerce sites, I'm interested in seeing how sales change. I am also a part of RuThrifty, a sustainability focused fashion club in Rutgers, so this dataset has the potential of informing me the potential trend for the future with family clothing retail stores.
